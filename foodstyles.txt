                        <p>One of the most popular Sri Lankan curries is the ambul thiyal - sour fish curry. This dish originated in Southern Sri Lanka as a way to preserve fish. Cubed fish, usually tuna, is sauteed in spices such as garlic, turmeric, black pepper and cinnamon. The secret ingredient here is goraka: a tamarind-like fruit that, when dried, gives the dish its distinctive tart flavour.</p>

                        <h1>Toddy & Arrack</h1>
                        <p>'Toddy' is a sharp local alcoholic drink made in the first fermenting stages of the sap of palm trees. 'Arrack' is a further fermented and refined version of 'Toddy'. 'Arrack' could be one of the oldest distilled spirits in the world - it has been traced back to 5th century AD, and is the national spirit of Sri Lanka. It's considered best mixed with local ginger ale to form a tasty, refreshing tipple. The process of collecting the sap is called 'Toddy tapping'. The toddy tapper climbs the coconut trees and walks on weather-worn tightropes from tree to tree, collecting the coconut flowers when they're ready for harvesting. </p>

                        <p>If you're feeling thirsty on a hot day, reach for a large orange king coconut. Full of delicious and nutritious ingredients, king coconuts are indigenous to Sri Lanka. Youâ€™ll find plenty on offer in the markets and street vendors, ready for you to try. Just remember to say no to plastic straws! They can cut the top of the coconut big enough to drink straight from. Coconuts play a strong part in Sri Lankan cuisine: from frying vegetables in coconut oil, adding coconut milk to curries to cool down the spices, and using coconut flesh to make spicy sambol - an accompaniment for bread and rice. </p>
