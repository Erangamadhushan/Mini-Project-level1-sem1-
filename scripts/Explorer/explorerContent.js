Visit Yala National Park to spot elusive leopards, or head to the remote Gal Oya National Park to see Asian elephants swimming and socialising. A Sri Lankan safari might also include sightings of wild boar, buffalos, langurs, toque macaques, sloth bears, crocodiles, whales, dolphins and the countless other species that reside here."

The general atmosphere is very laid-back, offering a refreshingly slow pace and serene environment for travellers to discover its charms. The people of Sri Lanka have many ways to make visitors feel at home. Known for their generosity and vibrant spirit that's demonstrated through dance, food, art and festivals (there are around 25 national holidays a year in Sri Lanka) it seems there is always an open invitation to celebrate something."

The Portuguese arrived in 1505, and Sri Lanka was then colonised by the Dutch and the British before gaining independence in 1948. This history has created a rich and diverse culture, where ancient traditions coexist with more modern heritage. You can see evidence of Sri Lanka's eclectic influences in the juxtaposition of ornate ancient temples and grand colonial buildings, particularly in its coastal cities and the capital Colombo."

In fact, you might recognise its former name - Ceylon - as a variety of tea that's still popular today. Sri Lanka's tea country is a gorgeous expanse of undulating green hills and lush plantations. It's one of the only places on earth where tea is still harvested by hand. Here you can learn about traditional methods and sample premium brews as you breathe in the fresh highland air."

The northern and eastern regions tend to be drier and hotter, while the central highlands see the most rainfall. The best time to visit Sri Lanka depends on your interests. For beach holidays, plan your trip from November to March; for wildlife spotting, the best season is May to October."
